About me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical Engineering specializing in data science and signal processing for health and wellness monitoring. My experience is extensive in FEM simulations, signal processing, data mining, coding with Python, MATLAB, and Fortran, as well as medical and assistive devices design and programming. I have conducted research in data analytics for health monitoring and extracting actionable information from various physiological time-series data using novel machine learning methods. My research experience and practical knowledge in machine learning and data science, background in mechanical engineering with focus on data analysis, and my knowledge in biomedical engineering, in addition to the long track record of successful and on-time project delivery have prepared me for working in multidisciplinary teams.
